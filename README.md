Small back-end application for managing beer stock through a REST API created with Spring Boot.

Followed steps:

- Initial Project Setup with Spring Boot Initialzr;
- Development of beer stock management operations (registration, reading, updating quantity and removing);
- Relation of each of those management operations with the REST architectural pattern;
- Development of controller and service unit tests for all the features using JUnit, Mockito, and Hamcrest;
- Application of TDD for the construction of a new feature (decrement stock).
